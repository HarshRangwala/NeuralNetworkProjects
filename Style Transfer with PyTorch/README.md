# Style Transfer 
This code is an implementation of the paper [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf)

## Requirements
This program is written in Python, and uses pytorch, numpy, matplotlib.
A GPU is recommended because it can provide significantly speed up the training of a model. The speed may depend on the size of the image and other system configurations.

## Results
